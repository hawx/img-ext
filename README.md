# img-ext

Extensions for [img][].

The usage instructions will assume that you have [img][] installed, but that is
not strictly necessary. It is possible to run these with without you just need
to put a `-` between `img` and their name, for instance run `$ img-databend`
instead of `$ img databend`. The only negative is that you will not be able to
display help for the command.


## img databend

Install and use like,

``` bash
$ go install github.com/hawx/img-ext/img-databend
$ img databend < input.bmp > output.bmp
```
